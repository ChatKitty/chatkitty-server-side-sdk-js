ChatKitty is the first complete chat platform; bringing together everything that's
required to build real-time chat into Web and mobile apps. Getting started with ChatKitty
is easy and you get:

#### Reliability
Your user chat sessions remain stable even in the presence of proxies, load balancers and personal
firewalls. ChatKitty provides auto reconnection support and offline notifications so your users stay
in the loop.

#### Low Latency
With response times below 100ms, ChatKitty makes sure your users have a smooth and immersive chat
experience.

#### Cross-platform support
You can use ChatKitty across every major browser and device platform. ChatKitty also works great
with multi-platform frameworks like React-Native and Ionic.

We've spent a lot of time thinking of the right abstractions and implementing our API to be straightforward
and easy to use - making you more productive.

This TypeScript/JavaScript client was auto-generated and utilizes [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). 
The generated Node module can be used in the following environments:

Environment
* Node.js
* Webpack
* Browserify

Language level
* ES5 - you must have a Promises/A+ library installed
* ES6

Module system
* CommonJS
* ES6 module system

It can be used in both TypeScript and JavaScript. In TypeScript, the definition should be automatically resolved via `package.json`. ([Reference](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typings-for-npm-packages.html))
